## Introduction 🐱‍💻
- ShetraRides is a React Native-based cab booking application that allows users to book cabs seamlessly. Key features include ride booking, viewing ride history, real-time map directions from pickup to destination, user profile and secure Google OAuth authentication.
- Powered by <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/places-backend.googleapis.com"> Google Places API</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/directions-backend.googleapis.com">Directions API</a>, it offers recommended destinations and places for convenience. NeonDB is used for storing and displaying real-time dynamic data, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Initially integrated with Stripe as a payment gateway, the app adapts to India-specific constraints by bypassing Stripe to maintain functionality without compromising user experience as Stripe is not available in Inida.
